# ResumeBlazorSample
A project meant to explore Blazor WebAssembly to display the contents of a resume. Originally apart of a larger project this code has been ported to another repo and may not reflect the current status of the private repo project.

The complete project was used to create a pipeline to publish the contents to Github, Azure, and Namespace domains.
